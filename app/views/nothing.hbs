     This content is available to the view in {{body}},
     but Unite Themes look for the view in {{page/body}}.
     
     We render this blank file to {{body}}.
     
     But the real content for the page is pulled from
     from one of the view files: views/*.html and is
     supplied to the theme as {{page/body}}.
